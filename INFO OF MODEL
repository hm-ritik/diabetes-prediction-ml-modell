This is a ml model which predict 
A person is diabetic or non-diabetic  
step to make this model 
-> Analyze the dataset
-> do data-preprocessing 
   strandardization 
-> split the data into train , test data .
-> Fitting the data into model 
-> predicting The accuracy of Training and testing data 
-> calculating The accuracy Score 

Accuracy of train data 0.7866449511400652
accuracy of test data 0.7727272727272727
